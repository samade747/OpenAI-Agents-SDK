# 🤖 Multi-Agent AI System with OpenAI Agents SDK

A powerful, modular, and scalable multi-agent system built using the **OpenAI Agents SDK** — the production-ready evolution of the experimental **Swarm** framework. This project implements advanced agent orchestration patterns inspired by [Anthropic’s effective agent design](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents), enabling agents to collaborate on complex tasks in a structured and efficient manner.

---

## 🚀 Overview

- **Production-grade** orchestration using the OpenAI Agents SDK.
- Inspired by **Swarm**: introduces `Agents` and `Handoffs` for clean agent coordination.
- Implements **Anthropic’s multi-agent patterns**: Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Orchestrator-Worker, and Evaluator-Optimizer.
- Easily extendable and testable framework for building sophisticated AI applications.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 🧑‍💼 Agents
Autonomous components equipped with specific instructions and tools to handle specialized tasks (e.g., billing, support, search, summarization).

### 🔁 Handoffs
Dynamic mechanism to transfer control and context between agents based on task requirements or user queries.

---

## 🛠️ Design Patterns Implemented

> Based on Anthropic's recommended agent design patterns:

### 1. 🔗 Prompt Chaining
Sequential task execution where each agent handles a specific step.

### 2. 🔀 Routing
Task delegation to the most suitable agent using intelligent handoffs.

### 3. ⚙️ Parallelization
Concurrent execution of subtasks to boost performance and throughput.

### 4. 🧩 Orchestrator-Workers
A central **orchestrator agent** breaks down complex tasks and delegates to **worker agents**.

### 5. 🧪 Evaluator-Optimizer
Includes evaluator agents for feedback loops and performance optimization using **guardrails**.
